``` r
data("instacart")
```

Instacart dataset logs 1384617 observations over 15 Instacart online
grocery order variables. It not only keeps track of the user, order
products, reorders, day and times of orders, but also organizes each
product into departments and aisles they would be in store. For example,
the product, Grated Pecorino Romano Cheese, is found in the specialty
cheese aisle, which falls into the dairy eggs department. The least
ordered department is bulk, with 1,359 orders, while the most ordered
department is produce with 409,087 orders.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # â€¦ with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. The fresh vegetables aisle is most ordered from
with 150609 orders.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate( #this reorders the x axis.
    aisle = factor(aisle), #make it a factor
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n) 
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  labs(
    y = "number of items",
    title = "number of items ordered in each aisle"
) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% #so, the order of aisle, product_name matters?
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'aisle' (override with `.groups` argument)
